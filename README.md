# Infladona Twitterbot

This is a project I built for the past month while learning NodeJs.

The Infladona Twitterbot is a simple nodeJs app that scrapes the web of Mercadona online supermarket and saves all their existing products and tracks any price variation on them.

The app also posts a tweet with the price variation.

1st Deploy, with basic fetch and tweet function

2nd Deploy 8-Jan, introduced new conditions for more relevant price variations to be tweeted. > 5% for one price jump and 5% for 2 price jumps within 3 days.
