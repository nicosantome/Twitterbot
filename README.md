# Infladona Twitterbot

This is a project I built for the past month while learning NodeJs.

The Infladona Twitterbot is a simple nodeJs app that scrapes the web of Mercadona online supermarket and saves all their existing products and tracks any price variation on them.

The app also posts a tweet with the price variation.
